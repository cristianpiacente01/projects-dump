# University and personal projects

Currently, this repository contains all the projects created for the courses I attended during the Bachelor's degree and the Master's degree, both in Computer Science (at University of Milan - Bicocca), and also the LaTeX source code of the Bachelor's degree thesis and the slides.

It also contains personal projects.
