"""
Module for performing cross-validation on three machine learning models.

This module includes functions to perform detailed cross-validation for three types of models: 
Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. 
Each function exploits Stratified 10-Fold Cross Validation.

    Parameters:
